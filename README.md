## Solve Known Issues

* Q. When DJMAX is running and I press F7, the screen freezes for a moment and then it just steps down once.
* A. I don't know why this sometimes happens, BUT I know a solution. Just restart program.

* Q. Antivirus software detected it as a virus.
* A. A few softwares might misdiagnose because of keyboard macro. So don't worry, it has no virus.
